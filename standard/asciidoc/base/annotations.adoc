=== Annotated API

The `org.opengis.annotation` package provides annotations which enable GeoAPI to document the source,
original name, and obligation level of the various types and methods integrated from the various specification documents.

.Annotations in Java source code
****
All classes, interfaces or enumeration types in GeoAPI which are based on a published standard
shall have an `@UML` annotation documenting the standard in which are defined the type or method,
the original name of the element and the obligation level if other than mandatory.
As an example, the annotation label for the `ProjectedCRS` interface appears in the source code as:

[source,java]
----
@UML(identifier = "SC_ProjectedCRS",
     specification = ISO_19111)
public interface ProjectedCRS extends GeneralDerivedCRS {
    ...
}
----

which specifies that the type was defined in ISO 19111 standard,
in the `SC` "Coordinate Reference System" package as the type `SC_ProjectedCRS`.
In addition, that interface contains the method `getCoordinateSystem()` with the following annotation:

[source,java]
----
@UML(identifier    = "coordinateSystem",
     obligation    = MANDATORY,
     specification = ISO_19111)
CartesianCS getCoordinateSystem();
----

which indicates that the method was defined in the same ISO 19111 specification
but had the name `coordinateSystem` in the standard rather than the `getCoordinateSystem` name used by GeoAPI,
and that a non-null value must be provided by every `ProjectedCRS` instance.

<<UML-introspection>> shows how these annotations are available at runtime by introspection.
