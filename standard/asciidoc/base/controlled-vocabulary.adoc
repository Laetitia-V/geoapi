[.reference]_From ISO 19103:2015 §6.5_

GeoAPI distinguishes between two enumerated types depending on whether the complete set of literal types is known
when the code is originally created, or if the list may be extended at run time.
Many language provides an `enum` construct for the former case and GeoAPI defines the `CodeList` abstract class for the later case.

.Code lists in Java
****
The use of `org.opengis.util.CodeList` constructs includes accessing statically defined elements,
defining new elements and retrieving any element defined for the code list.
Considering, for example, `org.​opengis.​referencing.​cs.​AxisDirection`.
The following code could be used:

[source,java]
----
AxisDirection north    = AxisDirection.NORTH;
AxisDirection northBis = AxisDirection.valueOf("NORTH");
----

where the second locution will create a new value if it does not exist.
Special care should be taken to keep such calls consistent throughout the code
since the `CodeList` will create a new element if there are any difference in the `String` parameters.
