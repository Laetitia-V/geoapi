**Abstract**

The GeoAPI Implementation Standard defines application programming interfaces (API) in some programming languages
(currently {supported-languages}) for geospatial applications.
The API includes a set of types and methods which can be used for the manipulation of geographic information structured
following the specifications adopted by the Technical Committee 211 of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
and by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).
Those interfaces standardize the informatics contract between the client code,
which manipulates normalized data structures of geographic information based on the published API,
and the library code able both to instantiate and operate on these data structures
according to the rules required by the published API and by the ISO and OGC standards.

This standard complements existing OGC standards by defining language specific layers of normalization.
This standard does not replace the core standards developing the OGC/ISO abstract model but complements those documents
for developers by documenting the mapping of types and methods from the abstract model into some programming languages,
providing standard interfaces in the `org.opengis` or `ogc` namespaces and explaining the use of GeoAPI interfaces.

== Preface

This GeoAPI standard evolved from an effort at the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and in the free software community
focused on developing a library of interfaces defining a coherent data model for the manipulation of geospatial data
based on the data model defined in the OGC Abstract Specifications.
GeoAPI interfaces originates with the publication in January 2001 of the implementation specification
OGC 01-009 _Coordinate Transformation Services_ Revision 1.00 (Martin Daly, ed.)
which included a set of interfaces written in different programming languages and in the `org.opengis` namespace.
The GeoAPI project started in 2003 as an effort from several contributors to develop a set of Java language interfaces
which could be shared between several projects.
The GeoAPI project subsequently considered the interfaces of OGC 01-009 as version 0.1 of GeoAPI
and started working on GeoAPI 1.0 in collaboration with developers writing the OGC specification _Geographic Objects_.
Subsequently, the Open Geospatial Consortium jettisoned its own Abstract Specifications and adopted,
as the basis for further work, the standards developed by the Technical Committee 211 of the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in its ISO 19100 series.
The GeoAPI project therefore realigned its interfaces with those standards.
In 2003, version 1.0 of GeoAPI interfaces was released to match the release of the first public draft
of the implementation specification OGC 03-064 _GO-1 Application Objects_ Version 1.0 (Greg Reynolds, ed.).
The standardization effort of GO-1 took a couple of years during which extensive work was made on GeoAPI interfaces.
Release 2.0 of GeoAPI was made at the time of the final publication of the GO-1 specification in 2005.
GO-1 has been retired later, but a new working group has been formed in 2009 for continuing GeoAPI development
with a more restricted scope: to provide interfaces for existing OGC standards only, without defining new conceptual models.
GeoAPI 3.0 has been released in 2011 and 3.0.1 in 2017.

The GeoAPI documentation completed by the
<<conformance>> (Conformance),
<<java>> (Source Java Archives) and
<<python>> (Source Python prototypes) are normative, while the
<<content>> (Types and methods),
<<examples>> (Examples),
<<departures>> (Departures from ISO standards) and
<<legacy>> (Comparison with legacy OGC specifications) are informative.

The interfaces described in this standard follow directly, without introducing any new concepts,
from the previously published standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium and the International Organization for Standardization.

__Recipients of this document are requested to submit, with their comments, notification of any relevant patent claims
or other intellectual property rights of which they may be aware that might be infringed by any implementation of the
standard set forth in this document, and to provide supporting documentation.__
