Version 3.1 and 4.0 of GeoAPI covers the base of the OGC/ISO Abstract Model for geographic information.
GeoAPI 4.0 provides utilities, base types, metadata structures, geo-referencing and a feature model.
The geo-referencing data elements enable the creation of reference systems for spatial coordinates
and mathematical operators to convert coordinates from one coordinate reference system to another.
This version of the standard covers the specifications ISO 19103, ISO 19115, ISO 19111
(completed by some elements from the closely related OGC™ specification OGC 01-009),
ISO 19109 and four elements from ISO 19107 necessary to the implementation of ISO 19111.
Future versions of this specification are expected to expand this set of interfaces to cover more models
of the OGC Abstract Specification series, including notably geometry data structures,
with the 'pending' portion of the GeoAPI project already exploring these new areas.
