== Conformance

The normative publication of the interfaces occurs in the binary format specific to each target language.
The interfaces are distributed in a ZIP bundle along with the API documentation.
An online version of the API documentation, which may contain fixes for errata discovered after publication of this specification,
is available at the URLs listed below:

This specification makes certain requirements of libraries implementing this API and defines several conformance classes
for implementations covering different packages of the API or providing different levels of complexity in their implementations.
GeoAPI provides a test suite through which to establish conformance of GeoAPI implementations.
These requirements and conformance classes are presented in Annex A (normative).
